This Java project is a simple password generator.
This line declares the package where the class p1 belongs. It's a way to organize Java code into groups.
Here, we're importing necessary classes from Java's standard library. 'SecureRandom' is used to generate secure random numbers, and 'Scanner' is used to read input from the user.
This line declares a class named p1. This is the main class of our program
This is the main method. It's the entry point of our program, where execution starts.
Here, we're creating a Scanner object named scanner to read input from the user.
These lines print a simple banner to the console, indicating that this is a Password Generator program.
These lines prompt the user to provide input regarding the password's length and whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Here, we call the generatePassword method with the provided inputs to generate the password.
If a password is successfully generated (i.e., it's not null), it's printed to the console.
Finally, we close the Scanner object to release system resources.
The rest of the code consists of helper methods (getPasswordLength, getYesNoInput, and generatePassword) used to interact with the user and generate the password based on the provided criteria. These methods ensure that the program behaves correctly and handles user input appropriately.
